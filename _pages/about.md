I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Department of Geography and GIS. I completed my Ph.D. in Remote Sensing and Earth Observation, where I developed innovative approaches for urban livability assessment and building functional analysis using multi-modal deep learning methods.

My research primarily focuses on GIS, GeoAI, especially multi-modal spatiotemporal data fusion, and their methodological and applied studies, addressing challenges related to urban resilience, environments, and sustainable development goals. 

## Education

- **Ph.D.** in Remote Sensing and Earth Observation, University of Twente (2023)
- **M.Sc.** in Geoinformatics, China University of Geosciences (Beijing) (2018)
- **B.Sc.** in Geographic Information Science, China University of Geosciences (Beijing) (2015)


## Research Interests

My research focuses on the intersection of urban geography, GeoAI, and geospatial data analysis. I am particularly interested in:

- **Flash Flood prediction**: Predicting flood depth based on multiple geospatial data using GeoAI. 
- **Urban Livability Assessment**: Developing comprehensive frameworks to evaluate and measure urban quality of life using multiple data sources
- **Building Functional Analysis**: Extracting and analyzing building use patterns from various geospatial datasets
- **Deep Learning Applications**: Applying multi-modal deep learning techniques to urban research problems
- **Geospatial Data Integration**: Combining remote sensing, GIS, and other spatial data for urban analysis
- **Mixed-Use Building Classification**: Advanced methods for identifying and classifying complex urban building functions
