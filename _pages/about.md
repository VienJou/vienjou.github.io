I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Department of Geography and GIS. My research focuses on urban research using multiple geospatial data, GeoAI, and GIS. Previously, I completed my Ph.D. in Remote Sensing and Earth Observation, where I developed innovative approaches for urban livability assessment and building functional analysis using multi-modal deep learning methods.

My research primarily focuses on AI-based urban analytics, multi-modal spatiotemporal data fusion, and their methodological and applied studies, addressing challenges related to urban environments and sustainable development goals.
