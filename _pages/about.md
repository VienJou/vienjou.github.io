Welcome to my academic website! I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, focusing on urban research using multiple geospatial data, GeoAI, and GIS.

Research Experience
======
**Postdoctoral Research:**
Currently working on urban research projects at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, applying advanced geospatial analysis and artificial intelligence techniques to understand urban dynamics and livability.

**Ph.D. Research:**
During my doctoral studies, I conducted comprehensive research on urban livability and building functional analysis:

1. **Estimating urban livability using multiple data sources based on multi-modal deep learning**
   - Developed innovative approaches to assess urban livability by integrating diverse data sources
   - Applied multi-modal deep learning techniques to create comprehensive urban livability indices

2. **Exploring the mechanism between building spatial and functional characteristics and urban livability**
   - Investigated the relationships between physical building characteristics and urban quality of life
   - Analyzed how building spatial patterns influence overall urban livability metrics

3. **Extracting hierarchical building use information from multiple data sources using deep learning methods**
   - Developed methods to classify buildings into broad categories, detailed categories, and mixed-use classifications
   - Created hierarchical classification systems for urban building functional analysis

4. **Broad building functional information extraction using feature fusion based multimodal Transformer network considering mixed-use information**
   - Implemented advanced Transformer networks for building functional classification
   - Integrated multiple data modalities to improve classification accuracy, especially for mixed-use buildings

**Master's Research:**
- **Urban functional information extraction from high-resolution remote sensing images based on deep learning**
  - Developed deep learning approaches for extracting urban functional information from high-resolution satellite imagery
  - Implemented stratified processing methods to improve classification accuracy and efficiency
