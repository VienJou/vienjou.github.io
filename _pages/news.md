**[2025.10]** Invitation to Present on the session of [AAG 2026 Symposium on Spatial AI and Data Science: Frontiers and Applications](https://i-guide.io/aag-2026-symposium-on-spatial-ai-data-science-frontiers-and-applications/): [GeoAI for Multi-source Geospatial Data Fusion and Analysis](https://aag-meetings.secure-platform.com/aag2026/solicitations/93/sessiongallery/24794). This session aims to advance the application of GeoAI for multi-source data processing. We seek to explore methods that address the distinctive characteristics of various data types and offer practical solutions for their analysis. We invite researchers to share their work, showcasing innovative approaches to multi-source data integration and analysis. Additionally, we aim to engage potential new users interested in these methodologies, fostering deeper multidisciplinary interactions on this topic.
